# Day 3: Gear Rations

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3

## Idea
I grouped up digits that are adjacent to each other and multiplied them depending on their length using the `calibrate()` function.

example:
```
["4", "6", "7", ".", ".", "1", "1", "4", ".", "."]
```

will be calibrated into
```
["467", "467", "467", ".", ".", "114", "114", "114", ".", "."]
```

This way, I can get the adjacents and the whole numbers.

**What about duplicate numbers?**
<br>
on this example:
```
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
```

**35 will be picked up as 35, 35.**
<br>
The `remove_adjacent_duplicates()` function that removes duplicate numbers that are adjacent to each other in the list.

### And from there I just did what I needed to compute.
